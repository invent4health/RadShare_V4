# Comprehensive Plan for Executing the Task

## Information Gathered:
- The `commandsModule.ts` file contains various command definitions related to viewport management, measurement handling, and tool activation.
- The commands can be activated through specific functions defined in the module, which can be called from other components.

## Plan:
1. **Identify Relevant Commands**: Review the `commandsModule.ts` file to identify the specific commands related to activating tools and managing viewport states.
2. **Usage in Components**: Provide examples of how to call these commands from other components, including any necessary parameters or context required for activation.
3. **Documentation**: Ensure that the usage of these commands is well-documented for future reference, including any dependencies or expected behaviors.

## Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `commandsModule.ts`: This file will be the primary focus for identifying command functions.
- Any relevant components that will utilize these commands may need to be updated to include the new functionality.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the implementation of the commands in the components.
- Test the functionality to ensure that the tools are activated correctly and that the expected behavior is achieved.
